WiND ANYCAST ZONE CREATION TOOL
# 2016-01-27 - Initial Release, as used by WAFN - JammiN

Once enabled via CRON, this tool will pull DNS records from WiND
and then create a valid zone file for BIND anycast servers

The created Zone file is compared to a live zone file. If newer it will
 - push the updates to the configured anycast servers.
 - restart bind on each server to read new DNS Zone info.


To enable this tool, do as following.

REQUIRES: named-checkzone (debian / ubuntu - apt-get install bind9utils)

Configure the following files as needed:
"zone_global_settings.sh"
"cron/wind" 

For each TLD Zone listed in the $ZONES array in "zone_global_settings.sh" do the following
  For a forward zone:
	In folder "dnszones-poller" copy the forward-example.conf and forward-example.schema
	Modify the copied file to suit your Zone and DB.
  For a Reverse zone:
	In folder "dnszones-poller" copy the reverse-example.conf and reverse-example.schema
	Modify the copied file to suit your Zone and DB

Check write permissions on log folder for the cron user.
Check +x permission on zone_update

Run a test (as the cron user) to make sure everything works.
 "wind/tools/dnszones-bind-updater/zone_update"

Once satisfied everything is working, enable it.
Copy "cron/wind" to /etc/cron.d/
