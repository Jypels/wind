WiND is a Web application targeting at [Wireless Community Networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_community_network).
It was created as a replacement for [NodeDB](http://www.nodedb.com/) by the members of [Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network](http://www.awmn.net/) located in Athens, Greece. It has evolved into much more as you can see below in the feature list.

WiND is distributed under[Affero GNU Public Licence v3] where each piece of code remains under the copyright of their respective author. Everyone can see the source code and everyone can contribute to it.

## Features
 * Supports multiple users and multiple nodes per user
 * User management: different access rights for each job
 * Stores all the node information a Wireless MAN will need: location, height, area, region, backbone & AP interfaces, roof view photos, subnets & hosts in a node etc.
 * Provides an easy (but powerful) way of searching for specific nodes
 * Using [NASA's SRTM data](http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/), it graphs the _Line of Sight_, and _Fresnel Zone_ between two nodes and calculates _Free Space Loss_ for the distance between them
 * Uses [http://maps.google.com Google Maps] to show the nodes and their links on the map.
 * Can be used to manage the distribution of IP Ranges and forward/reverse DNS assigned to each node (_Hostmaster_)
 * Fully themeable interface (using simple (X)HTML templates)
 * Support for localication; Unicode/UTF-8 support
 * Integrates with BIND Nameserver for serving the DNS zones.
 * A WHOIS server is provided that serves the data using the [WHOIS protocol](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3912.html)
